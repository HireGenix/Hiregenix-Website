    <p><strong>Transparency and Ethics:</strong> Be clear about how <span class="highlight">AI</span> is being used in the hiring process. Address data privacy concerns and establish clear guidelines around <span class="highlight">ethical AI hiring</span>.</p>

    <p><strong>Combating AI Misuse:</strong> Be aware of the potential for <span class="highlight">AI-generated</span> application materials. While 88% of hiring managers feel they can detect <span class="highlight">AI-generated</span> content, 58% remain concerned. Develop strategies to verify candidate authenticity.</p>

    <p><strong>The Irreplaceable Human Element:</strong> Technology should augment, not replace, human judgment.
