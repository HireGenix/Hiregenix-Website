# Flickering Fix Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to Reduce Website Flickering

### 1. Layout and Hydration Fixes

**`src/app/layout.tsx`:**
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to prevent hydration warnings
- Improved font configuration with fallbacks and `adjustFontFallback: true`
- Added `preload: true` to font loading for faster rendering

**`src/app/providers.tsx`:**
- Added hydration safety check with `useHydrationSafe` hook
- Implemented temporary skeleton during hydration to prevent flash
- Added `enableColorScheme` to CssBaseline for consistent color rendering

### 2. Enhanced Emotion Cache

**`src/app/EmotionCache.tsx`:**
- Improved emotion cache handling to prevent style injection conflicts
- Separated global and component styles rendering
- Better error handling for style insertion

### 3. CSS Optimizations

**`src/app/globals.css`:**
- Added anti-flicker CSS rules
- Implemented smooth scrolling and stable layout properties
- Added Material-UI button transition optimizations
- Added support for `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility
- Improved image rendering to prevent layout shift

### 4. Theme Configuration

**`src/theme.ts`:**
- Enhanced MuiCssBaseline with anti-flicker properties
- Added `scrollbarGutter: 'stable'` to prevent layout jump
- Improved button transitions with better cubic-bezier curves
- Added `willChange` property to optimize button animations

### 5. Custom Hooks for Hydration Safety

**`src/hooks/useHydrationSafe.ts`:**
- Created hook to check if component is safely mounted on client
- Prevents hydration mismatches by ensuring client-side rendering is ready

**`src/hooks/useIsomorphicLayoutEffect.ts`:**
- Uses correct effect hook based on environment (server vs client)
- Prevents SSR warnings

### 6. Utility Components

**`src/components/Common/HydrationSafe.tsx`:**
- Wrapper component that shows skeleton until hydration is complete
- Configurable skeleton fallback options

**`src/components/Common/NoSSR.tsx`:**
- Component for client-only rendering when needed
- Prevents server-side rendering mismatches

**`src/components/Common/PreloadImages.tsx`:**
- Preloads critical images to prevent loading flicker
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**`src/components/Common/FadeInWhenVisible.tsx`:**
- Smooth fade-in animations that respect user preferences
- Prevents jarring animation starts

### 7. Performance Utilities

**`src/lib/performance.ts`:**
- Debounce and throttle functions for smooth interactions
- User preference detection for reduced motion
- Critical resource preloading utilities
- Defined critical images list for preloading

### 8. Component-Specific Fixes

**`src/components/Home/BlogResourcesSection.tsx`:**
- Added hydration safety checks
- Implemented skeleton loading states
- Improved loading state handling to prevent content jumps

## Key Improvements

1. **Hydration Mismatch Prevention**: Components now safely render on both server and client
2. **Font Loading Optimization**: Improved font loading with fallbacks and preloading
3. **Smooth Animations**: Better transition timing and respect for user preferences
4. **Stable Layouts**: Prevented layout shifts during content loading
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Debounced interactions and preloaded critical resources

## Result

These changes should significantly reduce or eliminate the flickering issues by:
- Ensuring consistent rendering between server and client
- Implementing smooth transitions instead of abrupt changes
- Preloading critical resources
- Respecting user accessibility preferences
- Providing stable layouts during loading states

The build completed successfully with all optimizations in place.
